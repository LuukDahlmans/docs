## Overview
WPShift provides you with detailed server metrics to help you monitor the performance of your servers. These metrics include CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. By monitoring these metrics, you can identify performance issues, optimize your server resources, and ensure your servers are running smoothly. WPShift saves up to 48 hours of server metrics data, allowing you to track changes in server performance over time.

## Enabling server metrics
To enable server metrics for your server, you need to install the remote monitor on your server. You can do this in the Extra software section of your server settings. Once installed, the remote monitor will start collecting server metrics and display them in the WPShift dashboard.

## Viewing server metrics
To view server metrics for your server, navigate to the server details page in the WPShift dashboard. Here you will find a detailed overview of your server metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk usage. You can also view historical data to track changes in server performance over time.

### CPU usage
The CPU usage metric shows the percentage of CPU resources being used by your server. High CPU usage can indicate that your server is under heavy load and may need additional resources to handle the workload.

### Memory usage
The memory usage metric shows the amount of memory resources being used by your server. High memory usage can indicate that your server is running out of memory and may need additional resources to handle the workload.

### Disk usage
The disk usage metric shows the amount of disk space being used by your server. High disk usage can indicate that your server is running out of storage space and may need additional resources to store data.
