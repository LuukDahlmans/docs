## Your WPShift account
### Updating your profile information
You may update your profile information at any time by visiting the [Account Settings](https://app.wpshift.io/profile) page. Here, you can update your name, email address, and password.
### Securing your account with two-factor authentication
At this moment in time, WPShift does not support two-factor authentication. We are working on implementing this feature in the future.
### Deleting your account
You can delete your account at any time from the [Account Settings](https://app.wpshift.io/profile) page. Please note that this action is irreversible and will permanently delete all of your data.
<Warning>Deleting your account will cancel your subscription and delete all of your account's data. Your data will not be recoverable; however your servers will not be deleted from your connected server providers.</Warning>

## Billing
The [billing](https://app.wpshift.io/billing) page in WPShift provides an overview of your accountâ€™s payment information, subscription details, and transaction history. This page helps you manage your WPShift subscription, update payment methods, and view past invoices.
### Viewing invoices
The Invoices or Transaction history section provides a record of past payments and invoices. You can download invoices for accounting purposes or to keep a record of expenses. Simply click on the invoice to download a PDF version.
### Cancel your subscription
To cancel your subscription, visit the [billing](https://app.wpshift.io/billing) page and click on the Cancel subscription button. Your subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. After that, your account will no longer have access to WPShift.
