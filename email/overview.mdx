## Overview
With WPShift, you can create and manage email accounts for your domains. This feature allows you to set up custom email addresses for your domain, such as `info@your-domain.com`.
Every domain you add to WPShift can have multiple email accounts associated with it. You can create, delete, and manage email accounts from the Email tab in the top navigation bar.

## How does it work?
We use trusted email partners to provide email services for your domains. When you create an email account in WPShift, we set up the email account with our email partner. You can then access your email account through a webmail interface or set it up in your favorite email client.

WPShift will automatically set up the email account, inbox and dns settings.

## Creating an email account
<Info>You can only create email addresses for domains that are managed through WPShift.</Info>
To create a new email account, log in to your WPShift account and click on the **Email** tab in the top navigation bar. From the email page, click on the **Create new email account** button. You will be prompted to enter the email address, password and server location for the new email account. Once you have entered the details, click **Create email account** to set up the email account.
