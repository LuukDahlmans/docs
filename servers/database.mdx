## Overview
WPShift provides a comprehensive database management system that allows you to create, manage, and monitor databases and database users for your WordPress sites. With support for MySQL databases, you can easily set up databases, create users, and assign permissions to ensure secure and efficient data management.

## Creating a database
When creating a new WordPress site using WPShift, we will automatically create a new database for you. However, if you need to create additional databases, you can do so in the database section of the server details page.

## Deleting a databsae
To delete a database, go to the server details page and navigate to the database section. Click the three-dot menu next to the database you want to remove, then select Delete. You’ll be prompted to confirm the deletion—once confirmed, the database will be permanently removed.

## Creating a database user
To create a new database user, go to the server details page and navigate to the database users section. Click the **Create new user** button, then enter the username and password for the new user. You can also assign databases to the user by selecting the appropriate checkboxes.

You can use the host field to specify the IP address or hostname from which the user can connect to the database. By default, the host field is set to `allow all`, which allows connections from any IP address.

## Changing database user permissions
To change the permissions for a database user, go to the server details page and navigate to the database users section. Click the three-dot menu next to the user you want to edit, then select edit permissions. You can then modify the user’s permissions by selecting or deselecting the databases.

## Deleting a database user
To delete a database user, go to the server details page and navigate to the database users section. Click the three-dot menu next to the user you want to remove, then select Delete. You’ll be prompted to confirm the deletion—once confirmed, the user will be permanently removed.
