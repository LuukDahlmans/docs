### Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the loading performance of your site's main content. To improve LCP, you can optimize your site's images, fonts, and CSS to load faster and reduce the time it takes for users to see your content.

### Interaction to next paint (INP)
Interaction to next paint (INP) measures the time it takes for your site to respond to user input. To improve INP, you can optimize your site's JavaScript and reduce the time it takes for interactive elements to become responsive.

### Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures the visual stability of your site's content. To improve CLS, you can optimize your site's layout and design to prevent elements from shifting unexpectedly and causing a poor user experience.

### First contentful paint (FCP)
First contentful paint (FCP) measures the time it takes for your site's content to become visible. To improve FCP, you can optimize your site's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to load faster and reduce the time it takes for users to see your content.

### Time to first byte (TTFB)
Time to first byte (TTFB) measures the time it takes for your server to respond to a user's request. To improve TTFB, you can optimize your server configuration, reduce server response times, and cache static assets to deliver content faster to users.

### Overall site performance
In addition to these core metrics, Google PageSpeed Insights provides an overall performance score for your site based on a combination of factors. To improve your site's overall performance, you can follow the recommendations provided by Google PageSpeed Insights and optimize your site for speed, user experience, and search engine rankings.
