## Overview
SSL certificates are essential for securing your WordPress site and protecting sensitive data. In WPShift, you can easily manage SSL certificates for your sites to ensure secure connections and build trust with your visitors.

WPShift uses Let's Encrypt to provide free SSL certificates for your sites. Let's Encrypt certificates are trusted by all major browsers and offer strong encryption to secure your site's data in transit. With WPShift, you can enable SSL certificates for your sites with just a few clicks. You can also install your own SSL certificates if needed.

### Requesting Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
To request a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for your site, click on the SSL button in the side menu of your site settings. This will open the SSL page, where you can see the current SSL status of your site. If SSL is not enabled, click the Generate lets encrypt button to request a Let's Encrypt certificate for your site.

### Installing custom SSL certificates
If you have your own SSL certificate that you want to use for your site, you can install it by clicking the Install existing certificate button on the SSL page. You will be prompted to enter the certificate details.
