## Overview
Backups are an essential part of maintaining your WordPress site. In WPShift, you can easily create, manage, and restore backups for your sites to ensure data security and peace of mind. This guide will walk you through the process of managing backups in WPShift.

WPShift uses Restic to back up your sites. To enable backups, ensure Restic is installed on your server. If it's not installed, click the Install Restic button on the backups page.
