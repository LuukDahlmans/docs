## Overview
SSH keys are a secure way to access your servers without the need for a password. WPShift allows you to manage global SSH keys for your workspace, which will be added to every server you or your team creates within that workspace. This makes it easy to manage SSH keys across multiple servers and ensures secure access to your servers.

#### Managing SSH keys
You can manage **global SSH** keys for your workspace by clicking on the **SSH keys** option from the workspace side menu. Here you can add, edit, or remove SSH keys for secure access to your servers. The SSH keys you add in your Workspace will be added to every server you or your team creates within that workspace.

<Warning>Global SSH keys will only be added to new servers, if you remove a global SSH key, the key will not be deleted from existing servers. You have to manually remove that SSH key from your servers.</Warning>
