## Overview
Redirects are a powerful tool for managing traffic on your WordPress site. In WPShift, you can easily create, manage, and monitor redirects to ensure a seamless user experience and improve SEO.

### Creating a redirect
To create a new redirect, click on the Redirects button in the side menu of your site settings. This will open the Redirects page, where you can see a list of existing redirects and create new ones.

#### Status codes
Status codes indicate the type of redirect you want to create. This is important for SEO and user experience. You can choose from the following status codes:
- **301 (Permanent Redirect)**: This indicates that the content has permanently moved to a new location.
- **302 (Temporary Redirect)**: This indicates that the content has temporarily moved to a new location.
- **303 (See Other)**: This indicates that the response to the request can be found under a different URI.
- **307 (Temporary Redirect)**: This indicates that the content has temporarily moved to a new location, but the method of the request should not change.
- **308 (Permanent Redirect)**: This indicates that the content has permanently moved to a new location, but the method of the request should not change.
