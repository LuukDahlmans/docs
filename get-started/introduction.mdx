## What is WPShift?
WPShift streamlines the complexities of managing WordPress by bringing servers, sites, domains, and email management into one unified platform. Designed for both developers and business owners, WPShift provides intuitive tools that make tasks like server setup, WordPress installation, and domain configuration effortless.
Unlike traditional hosting companies that offer shared or managed hosting plans, WPShift puts you in charge by enabling you to set up and manage your own cloud-based servers with providers like DigitalOcean, Vultr, Hetzner, Linode, and more. WPShift gives you full control over your hosting environment while taking care of the technical complexities for you. From server provisioning and WordPress installation to security configurations, backups, and more, our intuitive dashboard makes it all simple and hassle-free.
Getting started with WPShift is simple! All you need is an account with one of the supported cloud providers. WPShift currently supports DigitalOcean, Vultr, Hetzner and Linode. If you don't have an account with any of these providers, you can sign up for one by visiting their respective websites.

Once you have an account with your preferred provider, WPShift takes care of the restâ€”provisioning servers, setting up WordPress, managing domains, and more. No advanced technical knowledge is required. Start building and managing your websites with ease!
