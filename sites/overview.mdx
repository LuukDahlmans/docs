#### Creating a WordPress site from GitHub or GitLab
<Warning>Make sure your repository is set to private, sensitive information will be stored in the repository.</Warning>

To create a WordPress site from a repository, you need to connect your GitHub or GitLab account to WPShift. Once connected, you can select the GitHub or GitLab repository containing your WordPress files and click **Create site** to start the site creation process.

It is important to note that the repository should contain the necessary WordPress files, themes, and plugins required to set up the site in the root. Your database should be exported and stored in the root of the repository with the name `db.sql`.

#### Creating a fresh WordPress installation
To create a fresh WordPress installation, select the **Fresh installation** option when creating a new site. You will be prompted to enter the site name, site domain, and server details. Once you have entered the site settings, click **Create site** to start the site creation process.
We will email the login details once the site is ready.

#### Cloning an existing site
To clone an existing site from your workspace, select the **Clone site** option when creating a new site. You will be prompted to select the site you want to clone and enter the site name and domain. Once you have selected the site settings, click **Create site** to start the site creation process.

#### Migrating a site
Migrating an existing WordPress site to WPShift is easy, simply download our migration plugin and follow the instructions to migrate your site to WPShift. We will automatically create your site in WPShift.
**You can find your workspace API key in the workspace settings to connect with the migration plugin.**

### Managing site settings
