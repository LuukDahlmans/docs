## Overview
WPShift allows you to manage cronjobs for your WordPress sites, enabling you to schedule and automate tasks to run at specific intervals. With cronjobs, you can perform a wide range of tasks, such as updating plugins, sending email notifications, and running maintenance scripts, without manual intervention. By automating these tasks, you can save time, improve efficiency, and ensure your WordPress sites are running smoothly.

## Default cronjobs
When you create a new WordPress site using WPShift, we automatically set up a default cronjob for the site. This cronjob runs the WordPress core cron system, which is responsible for scheduling and executing tasks like checking for updates, publishing scheduled posts, and sending email notifications.
We also set up a default cronjob for the server, which runs system-level tasks like updating packages, cleaning up logs, and performing maintenance operations.
