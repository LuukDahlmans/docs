## Overview
SSH keys are a secure way to authenticate with your servers without the need for a password. In WPShift, you can manage the SSH keys installed on your server, allowing you to add, edit, or remove keys for secure access to your servers.

## Adding SSH keys
To add an SSH key to your server, navigate to the SSH keys section in the server settings. Here you can add a new key by clicking on the **Add SSH key** button. Enter a name for the key and paste the public key into the text field. Click **Add SSH key** to save the key to your server.
